# Deep-Learning
What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning involves training these neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These layers allow the model to learn increasingly abstract features from the data.

For example:

A shallow network might learn simple features like edges in an image.
A deep network can understand more complex features like the shape of an object or even the object itself.
Key Components of Deep Learning
Neurons and Layers:

Input Layer: Takes the raw data.
Hidden Layers: Perform transformations on the data using weights, biases, and activation functions.
Output Layer: Produces the final result (e.g., a prediction or classification).
Weights and Biases:

These parameters determine the importance of inputs and help the model make predictions.
Activation Functions:

Add non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn more complex patterns. Examples: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.
Training Process:

Forward Propagation: Data flows through the network, and predictions are made.
Loss Function: Measures the difference between predictions and actual outcomes.
Backpropagation: Adjusts weights to minimize the loss using algorithms like Gradient Descent.
Applications of Deep Learning
Computer Vision:
Image recognition, object detection, facial recognition.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Text generation, language translation, sentiment analysis.
Speech and Audio:
Voice assistants, speech recognition, music generation.
Healthcare:
Medical image analysis, drug discovery.
Autonomous Systems:
Self-driving cars, drones.
Why is Deep Learning So Powerful?
Automatic Feature Extraction: Unlike traditional ML, deep learning models automatically extract features, reducing manual effort.
Scalability: It can handle large datasets and complex problems.
Representation Learning: Learns hierarchical representations, enabling sophisticated understanding of data.
